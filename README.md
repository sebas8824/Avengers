This app was made using the Marvel API in order to check 20 comics per hero listed on the main view.

This used the following pods:

* Alamofire: To perform the networking
* AlamofireImage: To download images coming from an url

* SwiftHash: To generate a hash value in order to consume properly the Marvel API.

With this app you are able to:

* List 20 comics per hero
* Check the details of each comic
* Save in the local storate the comics marked as favorite.
* Check the details of each favorite comic.
* Work in offline mode, being able to browse the favorite comics.
